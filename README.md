# Introduction to the team
We are a group of high school students working out of Baltimore, Maryland, on the east coast of the United States. We come together from many schools across Maryland and Virginia and work at the Baltimore UnderGround Science Space (BUGSS) lab. We are working on a modification for oceanic algae to make it more easily able to collect iron. Iron is a limiting factor for algal growth in the ocean, and the food web is based on them as well. As iron levels are fluctuating in the ocean and phytoplankton populations are dropping, the food web is stressed. However, there is actually a lot of iron in the oceans, just not in a form accessible to life. Our goal is to bring that iron into a form that the algae can use, bringing balance back to the oceanâ€™s food web.
