        <p>The design of Xylencer was a lively process which started in February 2019 and did not stop until now. The
            project went through countless iterations, motivated by discussions we had with supervisors, stakeholders,
            experts and within the team. On this page, we proudly present the status quo of Xylencer.
            Our project
            consists of four pillars: Detection, Delivery, Remediation, and Spread. Each of the single pillars can stand
            and represent a project on its own. However, we believe the combination of all four pillars is most
            effective to fight off <em>Xylella fastidiosa</em>. Read further to get to know more about the principles
            and
            ideas
            behind the design of Xylencer, which changes the project has gone through, and how we scientifically
            addressed the challenges ahead of us.

                    <p>The first pillar of Xylencer is detection of <em>X. fastidiosa</em>. Since its first
                        detection in
                        Europe in the south of Italy in 2013, the pathogen has been detected throughout the
                        Mediterranean, reaching from Portugal until Israel [1; 2]. A major bottleneck is the
                        surveillance of <em>X. fastidiosa</em> occurrence via reliable and easy-to-use detection methods
                        (see
                        entry on <em>Martijn Schenk</em> in <a
                            href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR/Human_Practices">Human Practices</a>).
                        Current detection methods are quite labor-intensive and costly and therefore don’t allow large
                        scale monitoring of the pathogen’s spread. Xylencer tackles this problem by developing an
                        automated tool for in-field testing of <em>X. fastidiosa</em> in insect vectors using
                        Loop-mediated
                        isothermal amplification (LAMP). Insects are attracted by a plant mimic on which they feed and thereby transfer X. fastidiosa cells. In the plant mimic the LAMP reaction takes place detecting the pathogen in an automated manner.  This way, Xylencer will help to better monitor the pathogen’s
                        spread throughout Europe, enabling the more efficient coordination of control measures to combat
                        the disease. </p>
