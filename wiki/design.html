            <p> In 1/3 of the world’s oceans, the iron concentration limits phytoplankton growth.
                Iron is required for the photosynthesis and is a critical micronutrient for the base of the marine food web [5]. Phytoplankton populations have decreased by 1% annually [1], and this absence resonates up the food chain from tiny krill to massive whales [3]. Iron, in the form of magnetite, arrives at the ocean when wind blows it into the water. The concentration of iron dissolved in the ocean is very low because magnetite sinks to the seafloor and because microbes secrete molecules such as siderophores to capture most of the remaining iron [5].

                Higher concentrations of iron in the ocean or a better ability to capture iron could stabilize phytoplankton. This would also reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide and preserve the Antarctic ice. Oceanographer John Martin first suggested adding iron to the ocean to stimulate phytoplankton growth more than 15 years ago and numerous trials have been conducted [2]; one discovered that each atom of iron could draw 10-100,000 atoms of carbon out of the atmosphere, a potential CO2 reduction of 15% [4].

                        <p> In choosing between the many different types of phytoplankton to work on, we chose one that consumes high levels of CO2, has a high replication rate, exists in the habitat of interest, and can cover substantial ocean surface area. We therefore chose to engineer Synechocystis sp. (cyanobacteria), a model organism that many iGEM teams have used before.
                       </p>
                        <p> Our project will engineer cyanobacteria to transport iron into cells and reduce it to the bioavailable Fe(II) form. The increased iron levels will increase photosynthesis and growth of phytoplankton. This will stabilize the food supply for krill and the marine food chain and absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.

                                We want to understand the effect of iron concentrations on cyanobacteria growth. We will characterize cyanobacteria growth by using modeling and experimental measurements.

                                We want to modify <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. strain CB0101 to have the ability to grow in conditions with lower iron. This will be accomplished by adding iron transport, uptake, and binding genes from other cyanobacteria strains and species that evolved in iron poor environments. We will also modify the strength of an iron-sensitive promoter.

                                We want to use safe and ethical practices in modifying organisms. We will prevent phytoplankton blooms that are bad for the environment by engineering a safety mechanism so that our cyanobacteria die in environments with very high iron.
